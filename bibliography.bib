	abstract = {The large-scale structure of executing a computation can often be thought of as being separated into distinct phases. But the most natural form in which to specify that computation may well have a different and conflicting structure. For example, the computation might consist of gathering data from some locations, processing it, then distributing the results back to the same locations; it may be executed in three phases—gather, process, distribute—but mostly conveniently specified orthogonally—by location. We have recently shown that this multi-phase structure can be expressed as a novel applicative functor (also known as an idiom, or lax monoidal functor). Here we summarize the idea from the perspective of software architecture. At the end, we speculate about applications to choreography and multi-tier architecture.},

	abstract = {Data structures with a hole, in other words data structures with an uninitialized field, are useful to write efficient programs: they enable us to construct functional data structures flexibly and write functions such as append and map as tail recursive functions. In this paper we present an approach to introducing data structures with a hole into call-by-value functional programming languages like {ML}. Data structures with a hole are formalized as a new form of λ-abstraction called hole abstraction. The novel features of hole abstraction are that expressions inside hole abstraction are evaluated and application is implemented by destructive update of a hole. We present a simply typed call-by-value λ-calculus extended with hole abstractions. Then we show a compilation method of hole abstraction and prove correctness of the compilation.},

	abstract = {In distributed applications, the transmission of non-contiguous data structures is greatly slowed down by the need to serialize them into a buffer before sending. We describe Compact Normal Forms, an {API} that allows programmers to explicitly place immutable heap objects into regions, which can both be accessed like ordinary data as well as efﬁciently transmitted over the network. The process of placing objects into compact regions (essentially a copy) is faster than any serializer and can be amortized over a series of functional updates to the data structure in question. We implement this scheme in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and show that even with the space expansion attendant with memory-oriented data structure representations, we achieve between ×2 and ×4 speedups on fast local networks with sufﬁciently large data structures.},
